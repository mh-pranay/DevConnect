## What is DevConnect?

𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁 is a dedicated social media platform designed specifically for developers. It provides a space where programmers, coders, and tech enthusiasts can connect, share their projects, ideas, and updates, and engage with a like-minded community. Whether you're looking to showcase your latest coding project, seek feedback, or simply network with other developers, DevConnect offers a tailored experience with features like user profiles, post interactions, and real-time notifications—all accessible through both web and mobile interfaces.

---

## Project Overview

DevConnect is a mini social media platform tailored for developers to connect, share updates, and engage with one another. This full-stack application features a robust backend built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) and a modern, responsive frontend developed using React and Vite for the web, styled with MUI, CSS, and Bootstrap. Additionally, a mobile application has been developed using React Native, ensuring a consistent experience across platforms. Authentication is secured with JWT tokens, providing a seamless and secure user experience on both web and mobile interfaces.

The platform enables developers to create profiles, post updates (with text and images), follow/unfollow other users, and interact with posts through fully functional likes, dislikes, comments, and a multiple-comment system—all working perfectly across both web and mobile app interfaces. Users can explore a global feed or a personalized "Following Feed," with real-time notifications enhancing engagement. This project showcases expertise in full-stack development, RESTful API design, and modern web and mobile development practices.

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run DevConnect locally for both the web and mobile applications.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn installed
- MySQL installed and running
- Git installed
- For mobile development: React Native CLI, Android Studio (for Android), or Xcode (for iOS)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/devconnect.git
   cd devconnect/backend
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note*: Ensure `mysqlclient` is included in `requirements.txt` for MySQL support. If not, install it with:
   ```bash
   pip install mysqlclient
   ```

4. **Set Up MySQL Database**
   - Create a MySQL database named `devconnect_db`:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE devconnect_db;
     ```
   - Update the `DATABASES` configuration in `settings.py`:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
             'NAME': 'devconnect_db',
             'USER': 'your_mysql_user',
             'PASSWORD': 'your_mysql_password',
             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': '3306',
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Apply Migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a Superuser (Optional)**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Run the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup (Web)

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:
     ```
     VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/
     ```

4. **Run the Frontend**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # or yarn dev
   ```
   The web frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

### Mobile App Setup (React Native)

1. **Navigate to the Mobile Directory** (assuming it’s in the repo, e.g., `mobile/`)
   ```bash
   cd ../mobile
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure API URL**
   - Update the API base URL in your React Native code (e.g., in a config file) to point to `http://localhost:8000/api/` (or your backend’s IP if testing on a physical device).

4. **Run the Mobile App**
   - For Android:
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-android
     ```
   - For iOS:
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-ios
     ```
   Ensure your emulator or device is set up via Android Studio or Xcode.

## Usage

1. **Web**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. Register a new account or log in, then explore the platform.
2. **Mobile**: Launch the app on your emulator or device, sign in, and start connecting with other developers.
3. Create your profile, post updates, follow users, and interact via likes, dislikes, and comments.
4. Use the search bar to find posts or users.
5. Check notifications for real-time updates.
